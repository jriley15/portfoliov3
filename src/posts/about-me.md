#### Introduction

My name is Jordan Riley and I'm a software engineer in Tempe, Arizona. I graduated from Grand Canyon University with a B.S. in computer programming and I'm also employed as a software engineer at Willis Towers Watson. I started teaching myself how to code in Java when I was 14, and I've had a huge passion for it ever since. I spend a lot of my free time coding and I'm always striving to learn more and keep up to date with the latest technology in the industry. My first endeavors as a young programmer were making games using the Java2d graphics library. Since then, I've shifted my focus to the web and consider myself a well-rounded full stack engineer. Some of my hobbies outside of programming include gaming, lifting weights, and snowboarding.
