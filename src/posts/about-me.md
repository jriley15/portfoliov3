#### Introduction

My name is Jordan Riley and I'm a software engineer based in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm currently in my senior year at Grand Canyon University studying computer programming and I'm also employed as a software developer intern at Sandhills Publishing. I started teaching myself how to code in Java when I was 14, and I've had a huge passion for it ever since. I spend a lot of my free time coding and I'm always striving to learn more and keep up to date with the latest technology in the industry. My first endeavors as a young programmer were making games using the Java2d graphics library. Since then, I've shifted my focus to the web and consider myself a well-rounded full stack developer. Some of my hobbies outside of programming include gaming, lifting weights, and snowboarding.
