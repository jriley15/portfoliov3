#### Introduction

Hi, I'm Jordan Riley, a skilled software engineer based in Tempe, Arizona. I earned my B.S. in computer programming from Grand Canyon University and currently work as a software engineer at Willis Towers Watson. I discovered my passion for coding at the age of 14, when I taught myself Java and began creating games using the Java2d graphics library. Since then, I've broadened my skills and consider myself a well-rounded full-stack engineer, with a focus on web development. When I'm not coding, I enjoy weightlifting, gaming, and snowboarding. I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends, constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.
