#### Objectives

An experimental web app I built to help me practice graph/tree traversal/algorithms in general. I got kind of bored doing plain coding problems and decided to put a real-world react spin on my studying. So far it only has implementations for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and the A star pathfinding algorithm. I plan on adding many more at some point. It's a static web app so all the algorithms are written in front-end JavaScript.

#### Technology stack

- React 16.8.6
- JavaScript
