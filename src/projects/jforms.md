#### Objectives

The objective of this project was to create some type of HTTP forms based SaaS platform. I was initially going to target just developers who need an easy way to integrate some basic forms into their static websites without having to setup a back-end, but also decided to add some functionality for people who don't have any coding experience and just want to create a form for people to enter data like Google Forms.
