#### Objectives

I got the inspiration to start this project when I began researching different solutions for integrating an existing comment system
into my own portfolio blog posts. I figured it could be a fun system to build from the ground up and offer some value to me and possibly others.

#### Plans for future

I have a backlog of features that I want to eventually add to this project but I've decided to ship it in its current useable state and come
back to it at some other time. As it sits right now, it's not as customizable as I'd like it to be for developers.

#### Technology stack

- React with Typescript
- NextJS
- Material UI / Semantic UI
- Asp.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- Azure Devops / App Service / Container Registry / Application Insights
- Netlify
