description: "Soccer game remake using express and web sockets"
---

#### Objectives

The goal of this project was to explore web sockets with express using node. My friends and Iused to play an old flash soccer game called Haxball that inspired me to do this remake of it sinceI figured it'd be some what of a challenge to implement some of the math and 2d graphics. It's fully multiplayer but I never got around to adding in scoring or multiple games/rooms.
