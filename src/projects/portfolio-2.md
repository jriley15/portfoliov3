Blog post on this project [https://portfolio.jrdn.tech/post/portfolio-v2](https://portfolio.jrdn.tech/post/portfolio-v2)

#### Objectives

The objective of this project was to re-write my portfolio from scratch using more up to date technology and open source options. I go more into detail on some of the decisions I made and why in the blog post above.

#### Technology Stack

- React 16.8.6 (with hooks)
- Gatsby JS
- Material UI
- Sanity.io headless CMS
- React Reveal animations
- Three js
- Netlify CI/CD
- Amazon S3

#### Features

- Completely static site for fast rendering and SEO (Anytime I update content in the CMS, the CMS triggers a web hook in Netlify to rebuild the front-end and deploy it)
- No back-end despite having dynamic content
- Cloud managed CMS - Blog system and Project system
- Cloud managed CI/CD
- Themed UI & Simple UX
- Cloud managed contact form
- WebGL home page animation
- Custom written image carousel / gallery in React
