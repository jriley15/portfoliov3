#### Objectives

~~The goal of this project was to explore web sockets with express using node. I decided to re-make Tetris since it's an easy yet challenging game concept to implement. I used web sockets instead of a completelyclient side solution because my original plan was to make the game multi-player. After implementing all of thecore game logic, I decided to start working on something else instead of adding a multi-player mode.~~

I re-did this project without a back-end and keeping it only client-side since I don't intent on ever implementing multi-player.
